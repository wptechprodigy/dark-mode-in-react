# Dark Mode with React Library

This project is an implementation of dark mode in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

It's implementation started on [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-dark-mode-i886c?file=/src/index.js) and then I ran into a `JSON.parse()` issue where code sandbox was adding another field (_test_) to the **localStorage** just before the set item of dark mode.

I was stucked for a little while and just decided to push the work to my [github](https://wptechprodigy/dark-mode-in-react) repo to see what the issue could be.

I found out it was code sandbox adding that field.

## The Win

Finally, the toogle mode now works and I'll be including it in a Frontend Mentors's challenge.

I'll host this on `ghpages` to see the implementation as it breaks in code sandbox.

Anyways, that'll be it for today, thank you!
